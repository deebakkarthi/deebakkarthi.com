List the four general steps of MapReduce
?
- Splitting
- Mapping
- Shuffling
- Reducing
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

Map task takes care of ==loading, transforming, parsing and filtering==
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

Reduce task takes care of ==grouping and aggregation==
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What are the phases in Mapper
?
- RecordReader
- Map
- Combiner
- Partitioner
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->


What are the phases in Reduce
?
- Shuffling
- Sorting
- Reducing
- OutputFormat
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is the function of RecordReader
?
- Convert byte-oriented view to record-oriented view
- Generates key-value pairs from the input data
- Usually it read in byte values and generates `[position: data]` pairs
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is the function of Map
?
- Convert `[position: data]` to `[data: some_val]`
- Produces intermediate key-value pairs
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is the function of Combiner
?
- It is a local reducer
- Applies some user given function on the data present in that mapper alone
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is the function of the Partitioner
?
- Takes the intermediate key-value pairs and splits then into *shards*
- Then send the shards to the appropriate reducer as per user code
- Same keys go to the same reducer
- This is typically decided by a hash function
- The number of partition is equal to the number of reduce jobs
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is the function of shuffle and sort
?
- Download the data given by the partitioner
- Sorts them by key so that it can iterated easily
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is the function of Reduce
?
- Reduce works on one group at a time
- It iterates through all the key-value pairs of that group and applies the reduce function on them
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What does the outputFormat do
?
Separates the key-value pairs using a *tab* and write out to an output file
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is the usually the combiner class
?
The `Reducer` class can also be used as the combiner class
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->


What is the difference between `Reducer` and `Combiner`
?
The main difference is that the output of `Combiner` is intermediate and is used by the reducer. The output of `Reducer` is written out to disk

What is the default partitioner
?
Hash Partitioner
