- Go code organization
    - Go code is organized into *packages*
    - Each package is a directory that contains `.go` files. Go package are
      analogous to libraries in C.
    - The `main` package is not a library but rather it is the file where the
      `main()` function is defined.
    - This serves as the starting point for the program
- Command line args
    - Command line arguements are accessed through the `os.Args` variable.
    - It is a *slice of strings*.
- Random quirks of Go
    - Variables have a *zero* value. Unlike C where an uninitialized variable
      contains garbage value, Go variables have a default value


## Hello, World! in Go
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World")
}
```
