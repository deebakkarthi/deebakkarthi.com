> [!question]- What is parsing
> Process of discovering a derivation for a given sentence

> [!question]- Formally define CFG
> $G = <S, N, T, P>$
> $P: N \rightarrow (N \cup T)^+$


> [!question]- What is a sentential form?
> A string of terminal and non-terminals that is a valid step in some derivation

> [!question]- What makes a grammar context free?
> The LHS of all the productions have only *one non-Terminal*

> [!question]- Draw the Chomsky Hierarchy of Grammars

| Grammar | MOC              |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| RG      | DFA              |
| CFG     | DPDA             |
| CSG     | Linear Automaton |
| UG      | TM               | 

> [!question]- Give an example of things that are not a regular grammar?
> $a^nb^n$
> $wcw^r$

> [!question]- RG can count $\underline{\hspace{2cm}}$ and $\underline{\hspace{2cm}}$
> bounded sets and bounded differences

> [!question]- What is top down parsing
> Starting with the *Start Symbol* and working our way down to the *sentence*

> [!question]- What is bottom up parsing
> Starting with the *Sentence* and working our way up to the *Start Symbol*

> [!question]- What is a derivation
> Sequence of *rewrites* that produce a sentence

> [!question]- Are Floating point numbers real numbers?
> **No**. Limited magnitude of $2^{-32} to 2^{31}$ causes overflow and underflow
> There may also be unexpected loss of precision

> [!question]- How to identify ambiguous grammar?
> - Multiple left or multiple right derivations or
> - Left and right derivation produce different parse trees

> [!question]- Consider a grammar $G$. It's left and right derivations are different. Is it ambiguous?
> **No**. It is ambiguous only if the *parse trees are different*

> [!question]- What are the sources of ambiguity?
> - Context-free syntax
> - Context-sensitive things such as overloading

> [!question]- Give examples of ambiguity that occurs which is not caused by ambiguous grammar
> `a = f(17)` in ALGOL can either be a function call or a subscript into the variable `f`
> These sort of ambiguities needs to be resolved outside the CFG as they are not caused by CFG
