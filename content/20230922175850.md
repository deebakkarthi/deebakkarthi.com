- Java has 8 primitive types. They are
	- `int`
	- `byte`
	- `short`
	- `long`
	- `float`
	- `double`
	- `boolean`
	- `char`
- Every other type is built on top of these types
- These are *not objects*. They are stored directly on the stack
- Non-primitive types start with *uppercase* letters
- All of the above primitive types have their equivalent *object wrapper*. For example `int` has `Integer`
- This is why you can't call any methods on these primitive types as they are not objects
