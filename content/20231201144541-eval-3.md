2. Construction of Symbol table (0/1/2) (0- for no symbol but spec written, 1 for symbol tables without details, 2 for symbol table with details)
3. Type verification(0/1/2) (0- no verification but code available, 1 for scanty verification, 2 for complete type verification)
4. Extra credits(0/ 2) (0- attempt with no output or no attempt, 2- atleast four types of semantic errors identified found through algorithm written in listener only) (this will be evaluated only if the first three parts are completed)
