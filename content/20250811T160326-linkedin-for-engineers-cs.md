# Three things that you absolutely need in a linkedin profile
- Profile photo
  - The photo should ideally be from your shoulders up till your head. Leave very little room above your head
  - Have a natural smile
  - Business casual attire is fine for most industries but if you are looking to get into consulting or finance a suit would be better
  - Rotunda and the East school are some great location to take your photo
- Tailored Headline
  - Add a little bit more that "XYZ Student at UVA".
  - Add some of your core interest and things that you have done.
  - People usually use the `|` symbol to separate the above things.
  - An example would be *MS CS at UVA | Machine learning | Computer Vision | foobar member| baz Scholar*
- Experience
  - Copy paste everything that you would have in your resume.
  - Instead of a small summary, provide as much detail as you can in the experience section
  - Add media like a photo or video or a graph under the experience whenever you can

# Cover photos
- People at UVA usually have the Rotunda or some photo of the grounds as their cover photo
- If you have some photos of you in *action* - giving a talk, a group photo - use those.
- The cover photo can also reflect your interests.
  - For example a person interest in clean energy and has worked at wind turbine company has windmills as their cover photo
  
# Banners
- Mostly the open to work banners aren't necessary as recruiters assume all students are naturally looking for a job
- But there was one recruited who said that they filter using "Open to work". So if you want to keep the banner you can set it to
  "Recruiters only".

# Linkedin Algorithm
- Linkedin algorithm favors active participants
- Respond to as much messages as possible. Even if you are not interested and the message was kind of spammy, just reply with a polite
  "Thank you for this. But I'm not interested"
- This makes your profile "quick to respond". These profiles are the ones that are promoted to recruiters.
- Follow pages of companies that you like
- Comment on their post. Not just like or give the applause emoji. Comment something.

# Connections
- Never send a connection request without a message. Even if you had met the person,
  always include something before sending the request.

# Cold DMs
- When cold-dming always be as specific as possible.
- Help them help you by asking really specific questions
- Only message people that you have something in common with or has similar experieces as you


# Groups to follow
- Follow UVA's school page
- Join *[UVA Engineering alumni and friends](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/54544/)*
- Join *[University of Virginia Alumni, student faculty and staff](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/74737/)*
- When you join these groups, you can send message longer than 200 chars to UVA almuni
- When using the alumni filter in UVA's school page *don't connect*. When you click connect it send a request without a note
  automatically. Note down their name and go to their profile and send a request with a note.
