> [!question]-  What are the different ambiguities in NLP?
> - Lexical
> - Syntactic
> - Semantic

> - Eg: *Back*
> 	- back door (adjective)
> 	- back away (adverb)
> 	- My back hurts (noun)

> [!question]-  What is syntactic ambiguity?
> - Syntactic ambiguity deals with sentences that can have multiple syntactic forms
> - Eg: *I heard his cell phone ring in my office*!

> - As we you can see, *with the binocular* modifies the *lion*

> 
> - But this can also be parsed as *with the binocular* modifying the verb *saw*

> [!question]-  What is semantic ambiguity?
> This deals with the actual interpretation of the sentence. The above example can be interpreted in two ways
> - I saw a lion using my binoculars
> - I saw a lion which was wearing a binocular

> [!question]-  What is metonyms?
> a word, name, or expression used as a substitute for something else with which it is closely associated

> [!question]-  What are metaphors?
> Refers to a thing by mentioning another

> [!question]-  Difference between metonyms and metaphors
> - Metonyms are words that are used to refer to something else
> 	- Eg: Pentagon refers to the US DoD office
> - Metaphors are words that used to refer to something else too
> - But the key difference is that metaphors suggest a likeliness
> - When we use phrases like *the crown* there is no connection between the crown and the monarch. It is just a term used to refer the monarch
> - But when we are using metaphors we are establishing that one is analogous to another
