- _Classify this based on the [Distributed Deadlock Detection](Distributed%20Deadlock%20Detection.md)_
	- Edge-chasing
- _What is the name of the special message_
	- Probe
- _Explain the structure of the message used_
	- `(i,j,k)` indicating
		- $P_i$ initiated
		- Home site of $P_j$ is the sender
		- Home site of $P_k$ is the receiver
- _What does it mean when a process is said to be dependent on another in mathematical terms ?_
	- There exists a sequence $P_i, P_j, \ldots, P_n$ such that every process except $P_n$ is blocked and every process except $P_i$ has a resource that the previous process waits for
- _What is local dependency_?
	- If a process is dependent on another and they belong to the same site then they are said to be __locally dependent__
- _What is the data structure used here?_
	- An array known as `dependent[]` where the $i^{th}$ index corresponds to $P_i$ being dependent on it
- _Give the Chandy-Misra-Hass algorithm ?_
	- Sender
		- if $dependent_i(i) == true$ declare deadlock
		- else for all pairs of processes $P_j$ and $P_k$ that satisfy the following
			- $P_i$ is locally dependent on $P_j$
			- $P_j$ is waiting for $P_k$
			- $P_j$ and $P_k$ are on different sites
		- Send probe message `(i, j, k)`
	- Receiver
		- When a site receives a probe message `(i, j, k)` it checks the following,
			- $P_k$ is idle
			- $dependent_k(j) == false$
			- $P_k$ hasn't responded to $P_j$
		- If the above conditions are met, for ever pair $P_m$ and $P_n$ that satisfy the following
			- $P_k$ is locally dependent on $P_m$
			- $P_m$ is waiting for $P_n$
			- $P_m$ and $P_n$ are on different sites
		- Send probe messages `(i, m, n)`
- _What is the complexity of this algorithm_
	- $\mathcal{O}(m\times n)$ where $m$ is the number of process and $n$ is the number of sites
