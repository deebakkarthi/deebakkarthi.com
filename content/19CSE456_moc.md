# NNDL final project review PPT
1.	Abstract
	- Uncomplimentary nature of edge computing and CNNs​
	- Model compression using Knowledge Distillation​
	- ATCam modules​
	- Feature Map Accumulation (FMA)​
	- Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP)​
	- Saliency Maps​
	- Student model gained an accuracy boost of 9.86% over traditional KD methods​
	- Student matched and exceeded Teacher model by 1.52% while being 43.2% in size
2.	Literature Survey
	- Dropping​
		- Alippi et. al, Yao. S dropped elements probabilistically​
		- Molochanov used a more analytical approach (Second-order Taylor series)​
	-  Enlarging​
		- Han et. Al – Ghost Maps​
	-  Hardware-based Solutions​
		- Xing Wang – LCNNs in high silicon HI3519​
		- Alwyn Burger – FGPA​
	-  Knowledge Distillation proposed by Hinton et. al​
		- Papers by Huang et. al, Crowley et. al, and Furnello et. al propose some novel methods.

# Important Questions for Lab-based Components

1.	Construction of MLP with and without using predefined functions
2.	Construction of CNN with different hyperparameters.
3.	Constructions of different types of Auto-encoders
4.	Constructions of RNN and LSTM with different hyper-parameters.
5.	Constructions of PNN. 
6.	Different metrics and criteria for evaluating the performance of the Auto-encoders, CNN, and others.
7.	Visualization of metric curves and feature maps of all the above models.

| Component | Marks |
| --------- | ----- |
| Lab       | 40    |
| Theory    | 45    |
| Viva      | 15    |

Viva will be asked from the whole portion 

Coding environment:- Google colab 

Location :- in ab2/ab1 lab (exact location will be shared tomorrow)

Theory Paper pattern:
5 question (including problems) 
4*10=40M
1*5=5M
Each question may have sub divisions 

Concentrate more on unit-2 and unit-3 (for both lab and theory)

Problems will be coming from
1. Perceptron
2. Convolution and CNN
3. HNN
4. HMM
5. CRF

Also, u have to remember one question and problem for each topic.
lab split: 15 +15 +10
15 - CNN/ RNN
15 - Auto Encoders
10 - MLP
