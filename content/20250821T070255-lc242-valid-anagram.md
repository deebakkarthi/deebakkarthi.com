# Question
Check if `s` and `t` are anagrams


# First solution
- Create `{character: count}` dict for both strings and compare

> `O(n), O(n)`
> Iterate through both. Iterate for searching. Store both strings as lists

```python
dict_s = {}
dict_t = {}
for i in s:
	if i not in dict_s:
		dict_s[i] = 1
	else:
		dict_s[i] += 1

for i in t:
	if i not in dict_t:
		dict_t[i] = 1
	else:
		dict_t[i] += 1

return (dict_s == dict_t)
```

# Other ideas
- Sort and compare
	- `Time of O(nlogn) but constant space`

# Neetcode answer

- Create two constant space dict for the form {a:count} where a is the characters of the alphabet
- Then just iterate the strings and populate the dicts
- compare dicts
