- Mention the three types of list in haskell
	- Undefined
	- Empty
	- Partial
- Give an example for list comprehension
	- `[x*x | x <- [1..10]]`
- Difference between `**` and `^`
	- `^` is used for integer exponentiation 
	- `**` is used for floating point exponentiation 
- What are the three parts to a list comprehension
	- `[resultant expr | list to be iterated, filter]`
	- `[x*x | x <- [1..10], odd x]`
- Can we have multiple predicates for list comprehension
	- Yes
- Can we take elements from multiple sets ?
	- Yes
	- `[x * y | x <- xs, y <-ys, odd x, even y]`
- What function is used to check for empty list
	- `null xs`
- How to access a particular index in haskell?
	- Using `!!`
- Type of indexing?
	- 0-based
- How does comparison (>, <) work in list
	- The comparison is lexicographic
- What does `cycle` do?
	- Repeats a list infinitely 
- What does `repeat` do
	- Repeats an *element* infinitely
- What does replicate do
	- `replicate numItems fillItem`
	- creates a list full of `fillItem`. There will be `numItems` number of elements
