# Transitional Probability

- Probability of a certain sequence of tags
- $P(Noun,Model,Verb,Noun)$

## Process 
- Add two more words `<S>` and `<E>`
- Draw a bigram matrix

| Tags\Tags | N   | M   | V   | \<E\> |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| \<S\>     | 3   | 1   | 0   | 0     |
| N         | 1   | 3   | 1   | 4     |
| M         | 1   | 0   | 3   | 0     |
| V         | 4   | 0   | 0   | 0     |

- Divide each cell by the sum of the rows
- $P( N | <S>) = \frac{C(<S>N)}{C(<S>)}$

| Tags\Tags | N   | M   | V   | \<E\> |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| \<S\>     | 3/4   | 1/4   | 0   | 0     |
| N         | 1/9   | 3/9   | 1/9   | 4/9     |
| M         | 1/4   | 0   | 3   | 0     |
| V         | 4/4   | 0   | 0   | 0     |
# Emission Probability
- Probability of a word being tagged with a certain tag
- $P(Will == Noun)$
- To calculate Emission probability draw a table whose rows are *words* and the columns are *tags*

| Words\Tags | Noun | Model | Verb |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| Mary       | 4    | 0     | 0    |
| Jane       | 2    | 0     | 0    |
| Will       | 1    | 3     | 0    |
| Spot       | 2    | 0     | 1    |
| Can        | 0    | 1     | 0    |
| See        | 0    | 0     | 2    |
| pat        | 0    | 0     | 1    |

- These are the raw counts. We need them as probabilities so divide them by the total of each column
- $P(word\ is\ a\ noun) = \frac{C(word\ is\ a\ noun)}{C(noun)}$

| Words\Tags | Noun | Model | Verb |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| Mary       | 4/9  | 0     | 0    |
| Jane       | 2/9  | 0     | 0    |
| Will       | 1/9  | 3/4   | 0    |
| Spot       | 2/9  | 0     | 1/4  |
| Can        | 0    | 1/4   | 0    |
| See        | 0    | 0     | 2/4  |
| pat        | 0    | 0     | 1/4  | 

> [!Example]
> Let the sentence be `Will can spot Mary` be tagged incorrectly as `<Will,N> <can,V> <spot,N> <Mary,N>`
> The probability of such a tagging will be $1/4*3/4*3/4*0*1*2/9*1/9*4/9*4/9=0$
