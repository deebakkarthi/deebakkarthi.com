# Lexical Analysis
- It is a *aggregation and classification* process
- **Micro syntax** is the lexical structure of a language

# Token vs Lexeme vs Pattern
- Tokens can be thought of as predefined *categories* of a grammar.
Tokens can't be broken down further
- A lexeme is a part of the program that was matched
- A pattern is the RE of a valid token

## Example
- `main` is a *lexeme*
- `KEYWORD` is its *Token*
- `main` is its *pattern*
