# Variables
- `var` for variables
- `let` for constants. Constants are recommended

# Data Types
- `Int` 
- `Double`

# Strings
- Double quotes
- Escape quotes with a backslash if they are to be a part of the string
- Multiline strings with `"""`
## String interpolation
- Use `\()` with the variable name in between the parentheses to substitute the value of the variable in to the string
- `My name is \(name) and I am \(age) years old`
