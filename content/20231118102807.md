# Introduction to Hadoop
## What is Hadoop
- Framework to process huge amounts of data
- Set of open-source programs
## History
- Born from the Nutch search engine
## Components of Hadoop
- HDFS
- MapReduce
- YARN
## Challenges
- Transactions
- Non-parallel tasks
- Dependencies
	- Suppose one record has to be processed before another
- Low latency data
- Lots of small files
- Intensive calculations with little data


# Intro to MapReduce
- MapReduce is a programming model

# Hadoop Ecosystem

- Flume
	- Data flow
- Sqoop
	- Non-relational to relational mappers
	- Can generate MapReduce code

# HDFS
- Block
	- Smallest unit of data in HDFS
	- Larger data is broken down into blocks
	- usually 64 or 128MB
	- But if the data is smaller then it can be stored as such
	- ![Pasted image 20231118104836](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231118104836.png)
	- No need to pad smaller data to make it to the block size
- Node
	- A single computer that stores data
	- Hadoop follows *Primary-Secondary* architecture
	- The NameNode stores the metadata and instructs the DataNodes what to do
	- NameNode always picks DataNodes that are closer by or in the *same rack*.
	- This is called as *Rack Awareness* in HDFS
	- The data replication is also done with rack awareness
	- This is done by keeping track of *rackID*
	- ![Pasted image 20231118105218](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231118105218.png)
- Read/Write
	- Write *once*, read *many*

# HIVE
- RDBMS for big data
- ![Pasted image 20231118105548](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231118105548.png)

# HBASE
- Columnar Non-Relational Database
- Write-heavy tasks
- ![Pasted image 20231118110039](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231118110039.png)
- We have to predefine *column families*. These columns are stored together
- The columns in the column family is flexible. We can add columns to a family at anytime
- In the above picture `patient_details, hear_rate, timestamp` are the column families. `patiend_details` has two columns namely - `name, age`
