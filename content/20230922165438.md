What are the two different ways to classify data analytics
?

Explain the type of analytics done during the three chronological classes of analytics
?
- 1.0 : Descriptive
- 2.0 : Diagnostic
- 3.0 : Predictive and Prescriptive
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->

Differentiate BI and BD
?
| BI                            | BD                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Descriptive, Diagnostic       | Predictive                          |
| Simple, clean, small datasets | Large, raw, complex, varied dataset |
| What happened and Why         | New insights                        | 
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,270-->

What the different types of DBs used in big data and give an example for each one
?
| DB Type     | Name                 |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Key value   | Redis, Riak          |
| Document    | HBase, Cassandra     |
| Wide column | mongoDB, couchDB     |
| Graph       | neo4J, InfiniteGraph |
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,250-->

What is a wide-column database
?
The format of column can vary from row to row
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,271-->

Draw the apache Hadoop ecosystem
?

<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->

What is in-memory analytics
?
Do all the processing in RAM
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->


What is In-Database Processing
?
Integration of data analytics into data warehousing
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->


What is a symmetric multiprocessing system
?
A symmetric multiprocessor system (SMP) is a multiprocessor system with centralized shared memory called main memory (MM) operating under a single operating system with two or more homogeneous processors
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,271-->


What is tightly coupled multiprocessing
?
Symmetric Multiprocessing System
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->

What are the three types of multiprocessing architectures
?
- Shared Memory
- Shared Disk
- Shared Nothing
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,270-->

Explain Consistency
?
All nodes should see the same data at the same time
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,271-->

Explain Availability
?
- Node failures do not prevent survivors from continuing to operate  
- This condition states that every request gets a response on success/failure of nodes.
- Every client gets a response, regardless of the state of any individual node in the system.
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->

Explain Partition Tolerance
?
- The system continues to operate despite network partitions failures.  
- Partition-tolerant systems can sustain any amount of network failure that doesn’t result in a failure of the entire network.  
- Data records are sufficiently replicated across combinations of nodes and networks to keep the system up through intermittent outages.
<!--SR:!2023-10-07,1,231-->

What is the CAP theorem
?
Can have only two of Consistency, Availability and Partition-Tolerance
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,271-->

When to choose consistency and when to choose availability? give examples
?
- Choose availability over consistency when your business requirements allow some flexibility around when data in the system synchronizes.
-  Choose consistency over availability when your business requirements demand atomic reads and writes.
<!--SR:!2023-10-07,1,230-->

What are the different types of consistencies
?
- Strong
- Weak
- Eventual
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,271-->

What are the different variants of eventual consistency
?
- Monotonic Read
- Monotonic Write
- Read Your Writes
- Casual consistency
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->

What is BASE
?
Basically Available Soft state Eventual consistency
<!--SR:!2023-10-09,3,251-->



Differentiate ACID and BASE
?
| ACID                        | BASE             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Availability Less Important | Weak Consistency |
| Complex mechanisms          | Simple and Fast  | 
<!--SR:!2023-10-10,4,271-->

# Notes

## CAP Theorem
In the event of a network partition a Distributed System can either choose to be *consistent* or *available* but *not both*

### Simple Example
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHqjEjzAicA)

- Suppose we have two ATMs
- The supported operations are *Deposit, Withdrawal, Check Balance*
- There are no central DB and these ATMs are connected by a network
- Assume that a network partition occurs. Now the ATMs have to choose between being available and being consistent
- Case 1: Availability
	- If the ATMs choose to be available then they will operate even though they can't communicate with each other
	- Suppose your balance is 100 and both the ATMs have the same value now
	- A network partition occurs
	- You withdraw 80 from ATM A
	- You go to ATM B and withdraw 80. It will allow this transaction because as far as it knows your balance is still 100. The ATMs made a choice to service this request even though it knew the other ATM is unreachable
- Case 2: Consistency
	- In this case the ATMs will be unreachable until they can talk to one another
