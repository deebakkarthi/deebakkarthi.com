- What is tail recursion
	- Recursion call is the last operation
- How do you annotate tail recursion
	- Import `scala.annotation._`
	- Add `@tailrec` above the function declaration
- Where are the input methods in scala?
	- `scala.io.StdIn`
- Give some methods for type-specific input
	- `scala.io.StdIn.readInt`
	- `scala.io.StdIn.readShort`
	- `scala.io.StdIn.readLong`
	- `scala.io.StdIn.readFloat`
	- `scala.io.StdIn.readDouble`
	- `scala.io.StdIn.readBoolean`
- How to read an entire line
	- `readLine()`
- What is the equivalent to C's `scanf()` in scala
	- `readf()`
- What are `readf()2 and readf3()`
	- Similar to `readf()` but return 2 or 3 values
- How to use mutable lists in scala?
	- `scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer`
- How do you add to a `ListBuffer`
	- Using the `+=` operator
- In pattern matching how to match an empty list?
	- Using the `Nil` singleton object
- What are pattern alternatives?
	- Suppose we want the same set of statements for two or more cases
	- We can delimit the cases using the `|` to combine them
	- `case expr | expr | expr`
- Why are pattern alternatives needed?
	- Unlike in C, the matched cases doesn't *fall through*. So there is no way to represent common cases
- Use if expressions to match range of values
	- `case a if 1 to 10 contains a => println(a)`
