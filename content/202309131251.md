# DFA, RL, RE, RG
- Languages recognized by a DFA/NFA are known as *Regular Language*
- Grammar of a regular language is *Regular Grammar*
- *Regular Expression* represents all possible strings that can be
generated by a RG

# Disambiguitation

- Choose the token which has the *Longest prefix*
    - Suppose we have a lexeme `for8`
    - We have two production rules
        - $FOR \rightarrow for$
        - $ID \rightarrow [a-zA-Z\_][a-zA-Z0-9\_]*$
    - `for8` has a matching prefix of 4 for rule 2 and 3 for rule 1
    - We choose `ID` to be the token of `for8`
- Rule priority. Choose the rule which is defined first
    - Suppose we have a lexeme `for`
    - Rules are
        - $FOR \rightarrow for$
        - $ID \rightarrow [a-zA-Z\_][a-zA-Z0-9\_]*$
    - `for` will match with both and have equal length prefix
    - We will use rule 1 as it is defined first
    - So `FOR` will be token of `for`
