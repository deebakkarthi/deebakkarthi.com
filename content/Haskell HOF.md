- What are HOF?
	- A function that either
		- Takes in another function as argument
		- Returns another function
- Officially how many parameters does every haskell function take?
	- Only one
	- Functions are curried in haskell
	- Every function takes in one parameter and return another function which may take more params
- What are lambda functions
	- Anonymous functions
- How to write lambda functions
	- using `\(args -> expr)`
- Differentiate `foldl` and `foldr`
	- The func to `foldl` takes the `acc` first
	- The func to `foldr` takes the `x` first
	- Foldl won't work on infinite lists
- What is `fold1`
	- We don't have to give the accumulator value
	- But will fail on empty lists even though normal `fold` doesn't fail
- How would you make a function eval right associative
	- Using the `$` operator
	- `f a b c d` will be `((((f a) b) c) d)`
	- To make it `f (a b c d)` we can use `f $ a b c d`
- How to compose functions in haskell
	- Using the `.` operator
	- `f . g x` is equivalent to `f (g x)`
- Write a map function that first negates the values and then takes the abs of the elements
	- `map (negate . abs) xs`
- Rewrite using dot notation `replicate 100 (product (map (*3) (zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] [4,5,6,7,8])))`
	- `replicate 100 product . map (*3) . zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] $ [4,5,6,7,8]`
	- $ is needed as the last function takes more than one parameter
