- Describe Haskell as a language
	- polymorphic
	- statically typed
	- lazy
	- purely functional
- How to import a module into GHCi
	- `:module moduleName`
- What are the logical operators
	- `&&`
	- `||`
	- `not` a function
- What is the not equal to operator in Haskell
	- `\=`
- How is precedence represented in Haskell
	- Numeric
	- 1 to 9
	- 1 is low
	- 9 is high
- How to know the associativity of an operator in GHCi
	- `:info operator`
- How is associativity represented in Haskell
	- `infixl` for left
	- `infixr` for right
- What is the name of Haskell's standard library?
	- Prelude
- Function for exponentiation
	- `exp`
- What is the result of the following expression `"" == []`
	- True
	- a string is just a list of char
- What is list enumeration in Haskell
	- By using the `..` we can enumerate a list given it start and end
- How would you specify the step size when using list enumeration
	- If we give a second element, the difference between them is kept as the difference of the resultant list
- Consider the following code `[1, 3 .. 10] == [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 11.0`. What is the reason for this strange behavior?
	- `..` is just syntactic sugar for `EnumFromThenTo`
	- `EnumFromThenTo e1 e2 e3` is defined to stop when the value is greater than `e3 + i/2` where `i` is `e2-e1` or lesser than `e3 + i/2` for negative `i`
	- That is the reason for this strange behavior 
- What is the significance of `it` in GHCi
	- Stores the last computed result
- How to store fractions
	- using `Data.Ratio`
	- `22 % 7`
- Describe the type system of Haskell
	- Strong
	- Static
	- Automatically inferred
- Two key differences between Lists and tuples
	- Size
	- Homogeneity of types 
- What is the default associativity in Haskell
	- left
	- `a b c d` is equivalent to `(((a(b)) c) d)`
- How do you spot a impure function in Haskell
	- `IO` will be it's return type
- Is Haskell strict or non-strict
	- Haskell is non-strict
	- Expressions are evaluated lazily 
- How does Haskell keep track of all the expressions to be executed?
	- Thunk
- Pros and cons of lazy-eval
	- Always takes lesser than or equal number of steps to eager eval
	- Very useful when only a part of the expression is needed
	- Memory consumption may be very high
- How to print to stdout
	- `putStrLn`
	- `print`
- How to get input in Haskell
	- `x <- readLine`
- How to check time in runtime (not GHCi)
	- Using `typeof` from `Data.Typeable`
