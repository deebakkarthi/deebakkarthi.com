# Rubrics for lab eval-2
1. Design to spec similarity -0/1/2
2. Coverage of complete language in parser spec -0/1/2
3. Parser test cases -0/1/2
4. Refined CFG -0/1/2
5. Output and parse error -0/1/2

# Other Instructions
- No RE in CFG
- Split the parser rules into 4 parts
	- Gokul Reference
		- Expressions
		- Operator Precedence
		- Flow Control
			- If else
			- while
			- do while
			- switch case
			- for
		- Variable and function declaration
- Each person has to explain their part and execute a 200-line program to verify that the parser works
