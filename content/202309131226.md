# Types of errors
- Syntax
- Semantic

# Compiler Phases
- There are three parts to a compiler. They are
  - Frontend
  - Middle-end
  - Backend
- The frontend consists of $Lexer \rightarrow Parser \rightarrow Semantic\ analysis$
- Middle-end converts to *3 address representation*
- Backend does code optimization and code generation

# Optimization Techniques
- Strength reduction
- Deadcode elimination
- Loop Optimization

# Types of Linking
- Static
- Dynamic
  
# Types of loading
- Static
- Dynamic
