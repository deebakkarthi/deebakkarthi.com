Suppose we have two events $A$ and $B$. Joint probability is the probability of all possible pairs of the output. For example
- A, B
- B, A
- A, A
- B, B

|        | A=Red          | A=Blue         | P(B)        |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| B=Red  | (2/3)(2/3)=4/9 | (1/3)(2/3)=2/9 | 4/9+2/9=2/3 |
| B=Blue | (2/3)(1/3)=2/9 | (1/3)(1/3)=1/9 | 2/9+1/9=1/3 |
| P(A)   | 4/9+2/9=2/3    | 2/9+1/9=1/3    |             |

In the above example A is the first draw from an urn. B is the second draw
